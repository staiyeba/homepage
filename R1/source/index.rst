Sorry if it looks a bit sparse around here, we're in the process
of moving the Varnish Cache project to its own infrastructure.

If you want to help out, we will gladly take pull requests to the
new homepage, you can find it in
`this github repos <https://github.com/varnishcache/homepage>`_.  /phk


Privacy
-------

You can access the varnish-cache homepages with HTTP or HTTPS as you
like.

We save the logfiles from our Varnish instance for a limited period,
in order to be able to debug problems.

The old homepage ran Google Analytics, and we have continued that here
for now, but unless we actually learn something useful from the data
they collect, it will be discontinued.
